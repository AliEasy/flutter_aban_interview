### Architecture
This project uses **Clean Architecture** to separate responsibilities across layers:

- **Presentation Layer**: Flutter UI + Cubit (Bloc)

- **Domain Layer**: Entities + UseCases (Business Logic)

- **Data Layer**: Repositories + Remote APIs (Dio)

### Key Choices
- **State Management**: Cubit for simple & predictable state handling.

- **Dependency Injection**: injectable + get_it for scalable service location.

- **Data Models & Immutability**: freezed for concise data classes and union types.

- **Networking**: dio for HTTP calls with custom interceptors and error handling.

- **Persistence**: SharedPreferences + FlutterSecureStorage for storing tokens & user data.

- **Localization**: intl with .arb files, supporting multi-language extensibility.
